        <p>
          Asian Computer College was established in Mayapa, Calamba City on March 2000. During this year, the school offered both the College Short Computer Science Courses and Basic Education Curriculum – Complete Pre-Elementary, Grade 1 to Grade 4 and 1st Year and 2nd Year Levels. There were about 150 students in all levels during the first year of operation and around 18 teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          During its second year of operation, TESDA did not allow the school to offer vocational courses because they didn't want to use the same building that the elementary and high school students were using. The management had to choose between the technical courses or the basic education curriculum. After thorough study and observation, the administration decided to focus solely on the basic education curriculum. Thus, the college courses were no longer offered during the second year. Complete Pre-elementary, Elementary, and High School courses were offered, leading to significant growth — by 2002, enrollment reached about 200 students with a growing teaching staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third year marked a period of physical and academic expansion. The school added a new science laboratory, relocated the library to a larger space, and upgraded the computer laboratory to a fully air-conditioned facility with 30 computers. Additional classrooms were opened to accommodate the increasing number of students. By 2003, enrollment reached 398 students, with 22 teachers, a principal, an administrator, a school treasurer, and a president of the board of directors. In 2004, the school was relocated to a larger campus to house its growing population.

          Two years later, a new annex campus was established at Brgy. Punta, Calamba City — with two buildings: a two-storey structure for the High School Department and a one-storey building for the Elementary Department. The Annex later added a covered court, used for major events such as the Foundation Day of ACC.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, the school entered a partnership with Genetic Computer School, introducing robotics as part of the curriculum. That same year, the school participated in robotics competitions and earned third place. Since then, Asian Computer College has continued to uphold its commitment to providing quality education and creating opportunities for students to excel in academics, science, technology, and the arts.

          Today, Asian Computer College remains dedicated to nurturing globally competent and values-driven learners — ready to face the challenges of the modern world.
